# Analysis

[Cryptarithms][1] are puzzles where letters stand for different digits in an arithmetic problem. The problem  
is usually to figure out which letters stand for which digits.  
Often it helps to write equations using the letters. Algebra can then be used to solve for the letters.  
Sometimes you can narrow the possibilities for a given letter down to a small number of choices, and  
you just have to try them and see if there is a way to get a solution.  
  
In a cryptarithm each letter represents a unique value from 0 to 9, so it cannot have more than 10 different letters.  
A program is required that is capable of solving cryptoarithms in which only additions are performed.  
It is necessary that the program can find all possible solutions, if any, of the cryptoarithm problems given to it.  
The program must be able to solve cryptarithms with as many digits as possible, and when solutions are found,  
they must be shown in the standard output with their respective indicator of the number of solutions. 
  
## Input
  
### Format: 

``` 
SEND + MORE = MONEY 
```
  
```
  SEND 
+ MORE
= MONEY
```
  
### Requirements

- English alphabet characters.
- ASCII characters only.
- Uppercase and lowercase are different.
- Doesn't need to be valid words.
- Can't have more than ten distinct letters
  
## Development

- Several possible solutions.
- Each letter (char) has a different value between [0,9].
- Based on the 8 procedural instruction types.
- To get the amount of all possible solutions permutation without repetition is needed
  
### Basic rules for solving verbal arithmetic problems

1. Adding the same letter an even number of times results in an even number. A+A=2A(even)
2. If A + B == A, when it is in units B it is definitely 0, if not then it is 0 or 9.
3. The maximum carry is n-1, where n is the amount of numbers in the sum.

## Output 

### Format

```  
If there is more than 10 different letters then

  invalid input

Else
           
    9567 
  + 1085 
   ----- 
 = 10652 

1 solution(s) found
```

### Requirements:

- Only sums.
- Can show more than one solution if there are any.
- Show "invalid input" if there are more than 10 different letters.
- The numbers should be aligned to the right according to the number of digits of the largest number.
- After the first number, the rest of the numbers that add up must be accompanied by a "+".
- The last number, i.e., the result of the sum, must be separated from the numbers adding by a set of "-".
- The last number must be accompanied by an "=".

Cryptarithms Library

  Procedure Solve Cryptarithm
    Create max unique elements = 10
    Create letters as an array of chars with size max unique elements
    Create unique chars as Count unique characters (**words, *letters)
    If Words is valid then
      Create digit values as an array of max unique elements
      Initialiaze array values as zero
      Create amount of permutations as permutation(unique chars, max unique elements)
      Create solutions as 0
      For int permutation = 1; i <= amount of permutations; permutation++
        Find digit values(*digit values)
        Create values as an array of amount words 
        Convert Digits To Value(*values, *digit values, amount of words) 
        If Values Are Valid then
          Create max num size as Get Max Num Size
